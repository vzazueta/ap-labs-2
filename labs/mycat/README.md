Lab - mycat
===========

Rewrite the `cat2.c` program by using `read`, `write`, `open` and `close` instead of their library equivalents.

Then, generate a report with performance metrics between the existing `cat` command  and your `mycat`.
The format of the report is free, you can add charts or whatever helps to understand the speed of both approaches.
