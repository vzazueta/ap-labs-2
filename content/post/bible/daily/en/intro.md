It has been a while that I promised I'd submit a daily bible treasure. This is a time
for new resolutions and to make it happen. I'm planning to share some extracts from my
daily bible reading. I trying my best to post something at least once a week. I wish that
The Lord bless you with all this.

These is part of my every year plan, reading the full Bible from Genesis to Apocalypse.
This 2019 year I'm reading the [NKJV Chronological Study Bible](https://www.amazon.com/Chronological-Study-Bible-James-Version/dp/0718020685).
Publishers and authors did a great job in terms of arranging some order of Bible stories
in time. They're careful and advertise readers that there's no plan of modifying neither
giving a final and definitive order of events. They're basically trying give some historical
background to Bible's readers.

Today I was reading about Moses and his encounter with God in the Horeb mountain. God starts
his calling through a burning bush - Exodus 3

In chaper 4, God starts giving a life changing call to Moses, something that would change the
course of the Israel nation's history. A big deal for someone that had been out of Egypt for
around 40 years.

And, what was **Moses's response** to that God's calling:

_"...O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant;
but I am slow of speech and [b]slow of tongue.”_ - **Exodus 4:10**

**God says:**

_"...Who has made man’s mouth? Or who makes the mute, the deaf, the seeing, or the blind?
Have not I, the Lord?.._ - **Exodus 4:11**

God has the power to make it happen, when God says something, He will keep his promise. Our creator
is in our side, we cannot fear what ever comes if He's with us. God was calling Moses, it meant that
there was not doubt that God would be with him wherever he'd go and he did it. God did great things
through his loyal servant.

Next time you feel like you cannot do it or you're thinking that you're not made for that; remember,
if God has called you and you're walking on his purpose, there's not space for failure there, God will
do it as He promised. Just keep your faith in the Lord and He will do it.

God is your Creator, he knows everything about you, when He gives you a new comission, He will be there
and will make sure that your needs are provided on His perfect time.
