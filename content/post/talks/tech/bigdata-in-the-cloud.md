I had the opportunity to share some of the Big Data approaches that OpenStack is offering with the
Sahara project. With Sahara, you can deploy Hadoop and Spark clusters inside OpenStack infrastructure.

The forum I presented this was at the [Datalab Community](https://www.facebook.com/datalabmx/?ref=br_rs)

If you want to take a look on my presentation, feel free to take a look on it and comment.
