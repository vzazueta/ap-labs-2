This time I had an opportunity for presenting at Ameca, Jalisco. I presented at the [CUVALLES](http://www.valles.udg.mx/) 
university.

My talk was about some of the key features of Golang, Python and C/C++ programming languages. But, this was
not the main reason I choose this topic. The idea is to explain the process for choosing a good programming
language for your project. It's not about the language, it's about the problem you want to solve and which are
the features a programming language can offer you to solve the problem.


If you want to take a look on my presentation, feel free to take a look on it and comment.
