As member of the [OpenStack GDL](https://www.facebook.com/groups/openstackgdl/) community
this was the first time I present a topic there.

I talked about the Containers trending technologies and they're affecting the Cloud ecosystem, in this
case OpenStack. How OpenStack is driving the efforts for delivering Container as a Service and also
deployment of OpenStack on top of Containers.

If you want to take a look on my presentation, feel free to take a look on it and comment.
