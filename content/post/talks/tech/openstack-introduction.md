This is talk I gave a Zacatecas City about OpenStack. Basically, this is an introduction that explains
the origins of Cloud computing, some key cloud concepts and how OpenStack delivers Infrastructure as a Service.

If you want to take a look on my presentation, feel free to take a look on it and comment.
